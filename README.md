# Steiner's Pizza
This simple programm calculates the maximum number of pizza slices you can have making n cuts. I used a recursive function
The recursive formula is L(0)=1,L(n) = L(n-1) + n
The solution for this recursion is: L(n) = 1 + ((n+1)*n)/2
One programm uses the recursion and the other uses the solution
